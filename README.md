# simplglmdl

A tiny WebGL-based renderer designed for 3D faceted meshes. This project contains custom JavaScript classes located in the "src" directory, facilitating the rendering of 3D meshes while applying geometric transformations to them.

The camera's point of view can be adjusted either through touch events or by using the mouse.

**Dependencies:**
- jQuery
- Require.js

Please note that the project utilizes an older method for declaring and loading JavaScript classes.
